*"BEING FORWARDED AS RECEIVED"                                       Hello. I am Arvind Nayak (Mumbai).
We had booked Kuwait Airways flight Mumbai-Milan-Mumbai from MakeMyTrip tv site in December 2019 for a Pharma conference. Our visit dates were from 11th October 2020 to 18th October 2020. But due to COVID, we had to cancel the tickets from the MakeMyTrip app in August 2020.
Kuwait Airways deducted a nominal amount and returned a large amount of our refund to MakeMyTrip in September 2020 itself. But, since then, we had to run from pillar to post between MakeMyTrip and Citibank since our Refund amount never got credited to the credit card account as promised. There was no response to numerous phone calls and mails sent to MakeMyTrip.

Then, on 09th July 2021, I discovered the CPGRAMS site. CPGRAMS means Centralized Public Grievance Redress & Monitoring System. From that I got Direct PMO - Prime Minister's Office site - https: //www.pmindia.gov.in/en/main/

From the site given above, in a few words, I wrote my Grievance to the PMO office, attached the relevant documents (there is such a facility on the site) and a miracle happened.
1. I immediately received a registration no. in my email with all details of my complaint.
2. I got the name, email ID and direct phone number of the officer to whom my complaint has been forwarded. It all happened in 1-2 days.
3. On 13th July I received an email from MakeMyTrip (on instructions of the Ministry of Tourism) asking for a few details.
4. Everyday, I could track the progress of my complaint myself by entering the registration number-complete Transparency!!

And then, another MIRACLE happened on 19th July 2021. The refund amount was CREDITED to the bank account by NEFT from MakeMyTrip!!

Really COMMENDABLE!! No words to praise this fantastic initiative by the government- and it REALLY WORKS!!
It just shows the efforts of the government towards bringing full transparency in their working and their genuine concern for the citizens and their grievances! 

KUDOS to all concerned!!
Putting up this post so that it can help genuinely aggrieved citizens!!

CPGRAMS stands for Centralized Public Grievance Redress & Monitoring System
PMO site- https: //www.pmindia.gov.in/en/main/
A Centralized 
Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) 
has been established by the Government of India at http://www.pgportal.gov.in 

Can you imagine this is happening in INDIA ? 

The govt. wants people to use this tool to highlight the problems they faced while dealing with Government officials or departments like
1) Railways
2) Posts
3) Telecom
4) Urban Development
5) Petroleum & Natural Gas
6) Civil Aviation
7) Shipping , Road Transport & Highways
8) Tourism
9) Public Sector Banks 
10) Public Sector Insurance Companies
11) National Saving Scheme of Ministry of Finance
12) Employees' Provident Fund Organization
13) Regional Passport Authorities
14) Central Government Health Scheme
15) Central Board of Secondary Education
16) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan
17) National Institute of Open Schooling
18) Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti
19) Central Universities
20) ESI Hospitals and Dispensaries directly controlled by ESI Corporation under Ministry of Labour.

Many of us say that these things don't work in India . 
A few months back, the Faridabad Municipal Corporation laid new roads in an area and the residents were very happy about it. But 2 weeks later, BSNL dug up the newly laid roads to install new cables which annoyed all the residents. A resident used the above listed grievance forum to highlight his concern. To his surprise, BSNL and Municipal Corporation of Faridabad were served a show cause notice and the guy received a copy of the notice in one week. Government has asked the MC and BSNL about the goof up as it's clear that both the government departments were not in sync at all. 

So use this grievance forum and let all the country men/women/youth who don't know about this facility. 
This way we can at least raise our concerns instead of just talking about the 'System' in India . 

Invite your friends to register their grievances at this portal and ensure that citizens are heard and get the responses that are their due 

PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE IF U WANT OUR INDIA TO HAVE A BETTER TOMORROW & FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.*
